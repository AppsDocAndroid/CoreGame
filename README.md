CoreGame: a simple game for Android
===================================
The plot
--------

The rules are simple:

* protect the core
* gain health and collect bonuses
* try to score high!

This game is an Android version of [Hakim El Hattab's "Core"](http://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/core/).

The game is almost ready for release. However, I still need an awesome icon for it. Also, bomb bonus don't work, and there's no highscores and scores at all. Unfortunately, at this moment I have to suspend development. But I'll continue it within last days of august.
